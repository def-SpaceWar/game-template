# Game Template (WIP)

This is a custom template for making 2D games with the HTML Canvas element that is highly personalized.

## Usage

`pnpm run dev` starts the development server normally and
`pnpm run liveshare` starts the development server when it needs to be shared in a VSCode liveshare.

## TODO

- Add Text drawing class renderprimitive (not centered)
- Add Buttons (which means adding the Listener)
- Add Animated text drawing renderprimitive
- Make camera be able to zoom out when needed
